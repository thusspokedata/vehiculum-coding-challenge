<h1>VEHICULUM | Coding challenge</h1>

<h4>&emsp;First of all, I would like to thank VEHICULUM for the opportunity to do this coding challenge, which gave me the chance to learn a couple of new things while working on it. I really enjoyed doing it.</h4>

<h4>&emsp;If I had more time I would erase the "<span>&#60;</span> back" from the home page. And on the DetailPage I would use another component to put "Make and Model" above the carousel and leave the price under the carousel.</h4>

<h4>&emsp;I would also try to separate the files inside the folders more clearly and I would try to write better code. Sometimes when I don't know how to do something I do it in an intuitive way. Sometimes it works but sometimes it doesn't look very clean. I think the code gets better with growing experience.</h4>

<h4>&emsp; I would also write some tests.</h4>

## Steps to make the app work:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
